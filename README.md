# AgentPod

AgentPod was started as a simple agent framework in python which is being rewritten in Go for the sole purpose of using it in [Agent Berlin](https://agentberlin.ai). The upside of that is, it's been used in production handling scale and is battle tested. The downside is that it's very strict in the design and only has the features we needed for Berlin to work.
